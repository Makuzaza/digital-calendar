# Calendar as as Service

Welcome to Your Own Digital Advent [ YODA ] calendars platform!
Whether it's counting down to Christmas, celebrating birthdays, or marking other special events, users can easily customize their calendars to suit their preferences and surprise their audience.

In this project our mission is to blend the traditional advent calendars with the convenience of digital technology.

YODA is a Software Development Team Project developed as part of the curriculum at Business College Helsinki.

It was created in response to the needs of a client, simulating a real-life scrum project, to provide a modern solution for digital advent calendars.
